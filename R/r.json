Those two modes were inspired by allopatric and peripatric speciation respectively.Both models (symmetric and asymmetric) were created and implemented so that different processes (distributions) for speciation and extinction could be independently and explicitly specified.

{"name": ["CRAN - Package TreeSim"], "author": "2014-09-18", "des": ["The package simulates phylogenetic trees where (i) all tips are sampled at one time point or (ii) tips are sampled sequentially through time. (i) For sampling at one time point, simulations are performed under a constant rate birth-death process, conditioned on having a fixed number of final tips (sim.bd.taxa), or a fixed age (sim.bd.age), or a fixed age and number of tips (sim.bd.taxa.age). When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa). The function sim.bd.age (and sim.rateshift.taxa without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using LTT.plot, LTT.plot.gen and LTT.average.root. TreeSim further samples trees with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a fixed number m>>n of tips is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa). This latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models (details in the sim.gsa.taxa man page). For incomplete phylogeny, the missing speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt for serially sampled trees, where the trees are conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age. Furthermore, for a multitype-branching process with sequential sampling, trees on a fixed number of tips can be simulated using sim.bdtypes.stt.taxa. This function further allows to simulate under epidemiological models with an exposed class.

It provides tools for modeling of Gaussian processes in space and time defined through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The SPDE is solved in the spectral space, and after discretizing in time and space, a linear Gaussian state space model is obtained. When doing inference, the main computational difficulty consists in evaluating the likelihood and in sampling from the full conditional of the spectral coefficients, or equivalently, the latent space-time process. In comparison to the traditional approach of using a spatio-temporal covariance function, the spectral SPDE approach is computationally advantageous. This package aims at providing tools for two different modeling approaches. First, the SPDE based spatio-temporal model can be used as a component in a customized hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). The functions of the package then provide parameterizations of the process part of the model as well as computationally efficient algorithms needed for doing inference with the HBM. Alternatively, the adaptive MCMC algorithm implemented in the package can be used as an algorithm for doing inference without any additional modeling.

The first technique addresses aleatory uncertainty in the system caused through inherent stochasticity, and determines the number of replicate runs necessary to generate a representative result. The second examines how robust a simulation is to parameter perturbation, through the use of a one-at-a-time parameter analysis technique. Thirdly, a latin hypercube based sensitivity analysis technique is included which can elucidate non-linear effects between parameters and indicate implications of epistemic uncertainty with reference to the system being modelled. Finally, a further sensitivity analysis technique, the extended Fourier Amplitude Sampling Test (eFAST) has been included to partition the variance in simulation results between input parameters, to determine the parameters which have a significant effect on simulation behaviour.

The number of components can be determined from the data, typically using the BIC criterion. In practice, however, individual clusters can be poorly fitted by Gaussian distributions, and in that case model-based clustering tends to represent one non-Gaussian cluster by a mixture of two or more Gaussian components. If the number of mixture components is interpreted as the number of clusters, this can lead to overestimation of the number of clusters. This is because BIC selects the number of mixture components needed to provide a good approximation to the density. This package, RmixmodCombi, according to \\emph{Combining Mixture Components for Clustering} by J.P. Baudry, A.E. Raftery, G. Celeux, K. Lo, R. Gottardo, combines the components of the EM/BIC solution (provided by Rmixmod) hierarchically according to an entropy criterion. This yields a clustering for each number of clusters less than or equal to K. These clusterings can be compared on substantive grounds, and we also provide a way of selecting the number of clusters via a piecewise linear regression fit to the (possibly rescaled) entropy plot."], "depends": "R (\u2265 3.0.2), ", "version": "1.0", "title": ["RmixmodCombi: Combining Mixture Components for Clustering"]},
